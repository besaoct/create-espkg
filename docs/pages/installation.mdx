# Installation

## Global Installation

To install `create-espkg` globally, you need Node.js and npm installed on your system. Once you have them, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g create-espkg
```

This will make the `create-espkg` command available globally on your system.

## Using npx

If you prefer not to install the package globally, you can run `create-espkg` directly using `npx`:

```bash
npx create-espkg
```

This command will run the latest version of `create-espkg` without needing to install it globally.
