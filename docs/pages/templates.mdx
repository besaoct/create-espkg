# Templates

## Creating a Package

To create a new package, run the `create-espkg` command followed by the name of the directory where you want to create the package. If you don't provide a directory name, it will prompt you for a package name and create a folder with that name.

```bash
# Create a new package in a specified directory
create-espkg your-package-name

# Or, simply run the command and it will prompt you for the package name
create-espkg
```

If you're using `npx`, the command will look like this:

```bash
# Create a new package using npx
npx create-espkg your-package-name

# Or, run npx and follow the prompts
npx create-espkg
```

## Template Options

After you initiate the command, you will be prompted to select a template. You can choose from the following options:

1. **`javascript (with types)`**: This template sets up a basic JavaScript project with TypeScript support and includes tools like Jest for testing and esbuild for bundling.

2. **`react-next (with types)`**: This template sets up a React project with Next.js and TypeScript, including all necessary dependencies and dev tools.

## Example

1. Run the command:

    ```bash
    create-espkg
    ```

    or using `npx`:

    ```bash
    npx create-espkg
    ```

2. Provide the requested information (package name, author name, and select a template).

3. The tool will create a new directory with the package name, copy the template files, and install the required dependencies.

4. Your new project is now ready to go!
